# Recommendation-System---OpenAI
In this project, I developed a recommendation system leveraging embeddings from customer reviews. Key steps included data preprocessing, generating embeddings using the OpenAI embedding model, and implementing cosine similarity for product recommendations. The results were visualized using t-SNE to illustrate the model's effectiveness.
